**Theseus Inc. Mods**, also known as **TAC Mods**, is a joint effort by the members of <a href="https://www.theseus-aegis.com/">Theseus Inc.</a> to bend the features and game-play of Arma 3 to the community's needs.

The mod is on the same foundation as the ACE3 mod, using its framework, systems, tools and standards. It is entirely **open-source** and licensed under the GNU General Public License ([GPLv2](https://github.com/Theseus-Aegis/Mods/blob/master/LICENSE)).

Huge appreciation and thanks to [ACE3 Team](https://ace3mod.com/team.html) for their open-source nature and permission to use their systems.


## Setup

### Requirements

- Arma 3
- Arma 3 Tools (available on Steam)
- Run Arma 3 and Arma 3 Tools directly from Steam once to install registry entries (and again after every update)
- [HEMTT](https://github.com/BrettMayson/HEMTT/releases) (>=v1.5.1) in project root _(Windows users can double-click `tools/setup.bat`)_
  - `hemtt` (Linux) or `hemtt.exe` (Windows)

### Procedure

_Replace `hemtt` with `hemtt.exe` on Windows._

- Open terminal (Linux) or command line (Windows)
- Run `$ hemtt build` to create a development build _(Windows users can double-click `build.bat`)_
- Run `$ hemtt release` to create a release build
  - _Only Windows release builds are currently supported due to binarization!_
  - **Add extension builds from [CI](https://github.com/Theseus-Aegis/Mods/actions/workflows/extensions.yml)!**
- Run `$ hemtt dev` to create a development build with file patching
  - `mklink /J <Arma 3>\x\tac <TAC_Mods>/.hemttout/dev` _(`/D` instead of `/J` for network paths)_
  - _`$ hemtt launch` is not supported. Use [ArmaQDL](https://github.com/jonpas/ArmaQDL)._

### Extensions

**Requirements:**
- Rust (>= 1.59)

Extensions builds must be invoked manually or via CI:
- Run `$ cargo build [--release]` in `extensions` directory
