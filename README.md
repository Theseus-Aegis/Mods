**Theseus Inc. Mods**, also known as **TAC Mods**, is a joint effort by the members of <a href="https://www.theseus-aegis.com/">Theseus Inc.</a> to bend the features and game-play of Arma 3 to the community's needs.

The mod is on the same foundation as the ACE3 mod, using its framework, systems, tools and standards. It is entirely **open-source** and licensed under the GNU General Public License ([GPLv2](https://github.com/Theseus-Aegis/Mods/blob/master/LICENSE)).

Huge appreciation and thanks to [ACE3 Team](https://ace3mod.com/team.html) for their open-source nature and permission to use their systems.


## Setup

### Requirements

- Arma 3
- Arma 3 Tools (available on Steam)
- Run Arma 3 and Arma 3 Tools directly from Steam once to install registry entries (and again after every update)
- [HEMTT (0.7.6)](https://github.com/synixebrett/HEMTT/releases/tag/v0.7.6) binary placed in project root ~~or globally installed~~
  - `hemtt` (Linux) or `hemtt.exe` (Windows) ~~or `setup.exe` (Windows global install)~~

### Procedure

_Replace `hemtt` with `hemtt.exe` on Windows._

- Open terminal (Linux) or command line (Windows)
- Run `$ hemtt build` to create a development build (add `-f` to overwrite already built addons)
- Run `$ hemtt build --release` to create a release build (add `-f` to overwrite already built release)
- Run `$ hemtt clean` to clean build files

**Windows Helpers:**
- Double-click `build.bat` to create a development build

### Extensions

_Only Windows extension builds are currently supported!_

**Requirements:**
- Rust

Extensions builds must be invoked manually, as they do not get rebuild with every release:
- Run `$ cargo build [--release]` in `extensions` directory
