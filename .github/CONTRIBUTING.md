Indicate if the issue appears on stable or development version. In case it is the development version, please also include the commit SHA-1 hash.

Please note:
- It's not valid to simply remove `@tac_mods` from the mod list to confirm that TAC Mods is the culprit.
- If the error happens when using a _third-party mod_ contact the author of the appropriate mod and report the issue there.
- Do not re-open closed issues, create new ones
