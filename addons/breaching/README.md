# About

Adds a breaching charge capable of destroying blocked doors and demolishing walls with minimal collateral damage.

This is an alternate and smaller implementation of [Breaching Charge](https://github.com/ampersand38/Breaching-Charge) by Ampersand. Source available [ampersand38/Breaching-Charge](https://github.com/ampersand38/Breaching-Charge) under MIT License, however this implementation is mostly inspired by it and most of the code has been rewritten in unscheduled environment instead.
